    , 'blurb' : '<p><a href="http://julialang.org/" class="softred" target="_blank">Julia</a> is a high-level dynamic language which was invented out of the greed to do more. Unlike other high-level dynamic languages, Julia is really fast. It inherits design tenets from the Lisp, builds on the good parts of C, MATLAB, R, Python and Ruby to create a language that is performant and highly productive at the same time.</p><p>Come to JuliaCon India 2015, on <strong>9th October</strong>, to learn more about various aspects of the Julia ecosystem: Language features and future directions, compiler optimizations, big data processing, multi-threading, concurrent and parallel computing, calling other languages, database interfacing, interactive visualizations, 3D graphics and more.</p><p>Julia is revolutionizing how businesses and researchers solve previously intractable problems rapidly. The conference will present case studies about production use of Julia at companies like <a href="http://www.justdial.com/" class="softred" target="_blank">JustDial</a> and <a href="http://www.loylty.com/" class="softred" target="_blank">Loylty Rewardz</a>.</p><p>The <a href="workshop" class="softred">workshop</a> on <strong>10th October</strong> is a comprehensive full-day coverage of Julia, delivered by the very people who created it â€“ Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, and Viral B Shah. <strong>Learn how a small, elegant language with a quirky type system makes for the best data science environment there is.</strong> Also learn about the diverse ecosystem of packages some of the smartest people in their fields are helping build. You really don\'t want to miss it!</p>'
