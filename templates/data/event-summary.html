Unlike other high-level dynamic languages, Julia is really fast. It inherits design tenets from the Lisp, builds on the good parts of C, MATLAB, R, Python and Ruby to create a language that is performant and highly productive at the same time. <p>We are proud to announce the first ever JuliaCon India. It will feature the creators of the language Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, and Viral B Shah, and an enthusiastic contingent of Julia programmers in India. It\'s a two-day event consisting of a day-long conference on 9th October and a post-conference workshop on 10th October.</p><p>If you are interested in talking at JuliaCon, feel free to propose a session on <a href="https://juliacon.talkfunnel.com/2015/" class="softred" target="_blank">funnel</a>.</p><p class="space-one-top text-center regular"><a href="https://juliacon.talkfunnel.com/2015/new" class="button-ghost-dark" target="_blank">Propose a talk</a></p>'
